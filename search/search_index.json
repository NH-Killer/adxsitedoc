ANDRAX is a Penetration Testing Platform developed for Android Smartphones and ARM boards, ANDRAX has the ability to run on Android so it behaves like a common Linux distribution, But more powerful than a common distribution! The development of ANDRAX began on 08/09/2016 (DD/MM/YYYY) only for people in Brazil ANDRAX has been fully redefined and reloaded on 05/10/2018 (DD/MM/YYYY) open to the international public. ANDRAX enable to all Android and ARM device with root access and storage become a weapon for Advanced Penetration Testing and Red Team operations. ANDRAX is developed by Weidsom Nascimento of The Cracker Technology - Advanced Pentest Why is Android and ARM so powerful? Simple, everyone has a smartphone and spends all the time with it! We have the possibility to camouflage easily in the middle of everyone, the processor architecture of most Android smartphones is ARM a modern and robust architecture extremely superior to the rest, With touch screens we can run the tools with great agility and take advantage of the graphical interface of Android, we can get in almost anywhere with our smartphones... If you do not understand how great it is you're not a Penetration Tester! With Android we have a lot of power in our hands, we can do everything we do with a desktop and more. ARM is the best architecture for processor, x86 is dead, computers are redefined nowadays! Why ANDRAX is better? Let's see why ANDRAX is the best Penetration Testing Platform... Portable ANDRAX is portable for any Android Smartphone using Android 5+ and space left and any ARM board like Raspberry Pi HardBased ANDRAX uses the most advanced structure inside the default Linux structure, this mean that ANDRAX can isolate process and install things with conflicting libs and resources in the same environment. With HardBased we an get a secured environment to run non trusted codes and/or deploy some types of tests that is not possible in others systems Modern ANDRAX is a modern platform, we have new tools that is not included on others system, we like the idea of give new tools and resources for professionals, others platforms are made by dinosaurs that like old things who not work on nowadays. Stable ANDRAX is a stable platform so your system never will break, we like put things in a infinity running loop, so we make our platform stable only updating things that is really needed and tools who has fast development, all is extensively tested to you get the best experience in Advanced Ethical Hacking More tools ANDRAX has more tools and resources than others platforms, we like give to our users the maximum of power as possible, our users are Advanced Ethical Hackers and Penetration Testers that can't wast time fixing bugs or installing things in the system ,so we make everything available for them. Optimized ANDRAX has a lot of optimizations enabled by default and hardcoded to bring the best experience to our users, ANDRAX is build to run in devices with low power, memory and processor power... Lightweight ANDRAX is extremely lightweight if compared with others systems, others systems require around 40GB of free space, ANDRAX only need 15GB to run at 100%. Artificial intelligence ANDRAX has resources for AI systems dedicated to Hacking, Machine Learning in Ethical Hacking is a grow up area nowadays and ANDRAX is in touch with it And much more If we were to list all the superiorities of ANDRAX we would spend an entire year writing ...
